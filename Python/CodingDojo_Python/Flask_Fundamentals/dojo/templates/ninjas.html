            <h1>About Ninjas</h1>
            <p>A ninja (忍者 ?) or shinobi (忍び ?) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan. The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare.</p>
            <h3>What did the ninja wear?</h3>
            <p>Myth: Ninjas wore masks when fighting and black clothes; it is their uniform. This is entirely false. These days most ninjas who are working as bodyguards would wear a suit or similar modern clothing.</p>
            <h3>Name of the ninja sword</h3>
            <p>Short sword (single-edge) ... The ninjatō (忍者刀 ?), ninjaken (忍者剣 ?), or shinobigatana (忍刀 ?) , are allegedly the preferred weapon that the Shinobi of feudal Japan carried. It is portrayed by modern ninjutsu practitioners (including Masaaki Hatsumi
                and Stephen K. Hayes) and is prominently featured in popular culture.</p>
