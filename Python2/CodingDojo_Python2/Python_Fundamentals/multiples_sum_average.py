# Multiples

# Part I - Write code that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use a list to do this exercise.

# for i in range(1,1000):
#     if i % 2 == 1:
#         print i
#     else:
#         i = i + 1

# or

# for count in range(1, 1001, 2):
#     print count

# Part II - Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

# for anythngHere in range(5, 1000000):
#     if anythngHere % 5 == 0:
#         print anythngHere
#     else:
#         anythngHere = anythngHere + 1

# or

# for count in range(5,1000001,5):
#     print count

# Sum List
# Create a program that prints the sum of all the values in the list: a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]

# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# sum = 0
# for add in a:
#     sum = sum + add
# print sum

# or

# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# print sum(a)

# Average List
# Create a program that prints the average of the values in the list: a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]

# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# sum = 0
# for add in a:
#     sum = sum + add
# print sum
# print sum/len(a)

# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
# sum = 0
# for i in a:
#     sum = sum + i
# print sum
# print sum/len(a)
