Example
The following script uses the DATE_FORMAT() function to display different formats. We will use the NOW() function to get the current date/time:

DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'%b %d %Y %h:%i %p')
DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'%m-%d-%Y')
DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'%d %b %y')
DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'%d %b %Y %T:%f')
The result would look something like this:

Nov 04 2014 11:45 PM
11-04-2014
04 Nov 14
04 Nov 2014 11:45:34:243
